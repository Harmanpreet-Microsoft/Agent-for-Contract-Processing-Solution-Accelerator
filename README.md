Solution overview
</h2>

The Agent for Contract Processing helps employees quickly create, find, manage and share contracts, saving time and resources by automating contract processing workflows. 

Leveraging Copilot Studio, Power Platform, Microsoft Teams, SharePoint and 3rd party e-signature tools, employees can generate, search and summarize contracts, automate e-sign processes with customers and converse naturally with the agent.

**Note:** This accelerator is not intended to be a production ready solution. The components can be extended through customization and configuration as desired to create a production ready solution. All components packaged have been done through an unmanaged solution, which allows users to be able to customize and extend the components post-deployment.

### Solution architecture

![Architecture](./Deployment/Images/architecture.png)

### How to customize
This solution is designed to be easily customizable. All configuration and customizations to this solution will be done in Power Platform and Copilot Studio.

**A note on extension opportunities with Conversation Start Adaptive Card**

Note that in the initial Adaptive Card that presents three options (Check if a customer has an NDA; Get information about an NDA; Create a new NDA), the first two options both currently initiate a search for existing NDAs in place for a given organization. As an extension, you may choose to include additional functionality for the second of these options, to provide additional summarization information about the agreement, beyond what is included in the Adaptive Card summary.

**Additional opportunities for extension**

There are a variety of opportunities to extend the functionality of this accelerator. Some of these include:

 * Including an in-house legal team eSignature signing step, rather than using a pre-signed template
 * Catering for customer-specific clauses in the agreement
 * Including an internal approval step, potentially using the [Approvals Connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/approvals/)
 * Integration with 3rd-party contract management systems
 * Using Generative AI to summarize agreement content, or compare content between a standard vs proposed agreement
 * and more

### Additional resources

This accelerator focuses on harnessing the following key capabilities:

* [User intent detection in Copilot Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/guidance/cux-identify-intents)

### Prerequisites and Costs - do not have content
{üü®TODO: Update with solution specific notes like role requirements}

To deploy this solution accelerator, ensure you have access to an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with the necessary permissions to create **resource groups, resources, app registrations, and assign roles at the resource group level**. This should include Contributor role at the subscription level and  Role Based Access Control role on the subscription and/or resource group level. Follow the steps in [Azure Account Set Up](./docs/AzureAccountSetUp.md).

Here are some example regions where the services are available: {üü®TODO: Update with suggested regions specific to this solution}

Check the [Azure Products by Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=all&regions=all) page and select a **region** where the following services are available.

{üü®TODO: Call out specific pricing "gotchas" like Azure Container Registry if known}

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage. The majority of the Azure resources used in this infrastructure are on usage-based pricing tiers. However, Azure Container Registry has a fixed cost per registry per day.

{üü®TODO: Update with solution specific estimate sheet}

Use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator) to calculate the cost of this solution in your subscription. 

Review a [sample pricing sheet](https://azure.com/e/68b51f4cb79a4466b631a11aa57e9c16) in the event you want to customize and scale usage.

_Note: This is not meant to outline all costs as selected SKUs, scaled use, customizations, and integrations into your own tenant can affect the total consumption of this sample solution. The sample pricing sheet is meant to give you a starting point to customize the estimate for your specific needs._

<br/>

{üü®TODO: Update with all products, decription of product use, and product specific pricing links}

| Product | Description | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| [Product Name with Link to Learn content](https://learn.microsoft.com) | Decription of how the product is used | [Pricing]() |
| [Product Name with Link to Learn content](https://learn.microsoft.com) | Decription of how the product is used | [Pricing]() |

>‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** To avoid unnecessary costs, remember to take down your app if it's no longer in use,
either by deleting the resource group in the Portal or running `azd down`.

Business Use Case
</h2>

Below is a sample landing page of the solution accelerator after it is deployed, set up, and ready to be used:
![Key Features](./Deployment/Images/landingpage.png)

An employee wants to initiate a request for contract creation (a Non-disclosure Agreement with a customer, or NDA in this example) to allow them to proceed with their sales opportunity with a second party organization. The employee chats with the Agent for Contract Processing in Teams, which helps the employee confirm whether or not an NDA contract already exists for the customer. If not, the agent initiates the contract creation by requesting all required information from the employee. Once the information is provided, the agent automatically creates a draft version of the contract and presents it to the employee to confirm if it's ready to be sent to the customer for eSignature. Once the employee reviews the draft and is satisfied, the agent sends the contract to the customer for the eSignature. Once the eSignature process is completed, the signed document is stored in SharePoint, and a Dataverse record is created which stores the status, SharePoint URL, agreement ID and other important details of the NDA Agreement.

By being able to get an executed NDA agreement in place quickly and seamlessly, and without involving in-house legal resources, the employee is able to proceed with their sales opportunity quickly, and the employee's legal department is able to focus on higher-value legal scenarios rather than repetitive tasks.
